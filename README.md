# Terraria Crowd Control
A mod for Terraria that allows the use of the [Crowd Control](https://crowdcontrol.live) Twitch extension.</br>
Crowd Control allows viewers of a Twitch stream to use Coins to cause events to happen in the streamer's game.</br>
Bits can be exchanged for Coins, rewarding the streamer. There are also free coins for viewers at the beginning of a Crowd Control session.

## Mod Installation
Search for, and download, the *TerrariaCrowdControl* mod in the Mod Browser in [tModLoader](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/). Upon entering a Terraria world, the mod will begin trying to connect to the Crowd Control Desktop Application. You will receive a message in Terraria chat when the connection is established.
</br></br>
Alternatively, the mod can be downloaded manually from the [Releases](https://github.com/MrG-bit/TerrariaCrowdControlMod/releases) tab. Place the *.tmod* file in the Mods folder located in "Documents>My Games>Terraria>ModLoader". You will then need to enable the mod in tModLoader.
</br></br>
The mod can be configured in-game through the Mod Configuration menu. One option worth noting is the ability to stop messages in Terraria chat from Crowd Control. This is helpful if you would like to use the Browser Source option instead through your streaming software.

## Source
This repository contains the source for the mod. You are not allowed to use the source code to publish your own Crowd Control mod. You would be unable to add new effects because that is handled on the Crowd Control servers.</br>
I know the code is pretty messy in places. It's my first time working with Crowd Control and making a tModLoader mod. If I were to remake this mod again knowing what I do now, I would structure it a lot differently. That being said, I'm still happy with how it turned out. It's not the worst, that's for sure.
