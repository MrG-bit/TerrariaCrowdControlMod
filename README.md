# Terraria Crowd Control
A mod for Terraria that allows the use of the [Crowd Control](https://crowdcontrol.live) Twitch extension.</br>
Crowd Control allows viewers of a Twitch stream to use their Bits to cause events to happen in the streamer's game.

# Mod Installation
Search for, and download, the *TerrariaCrowdControl* mod in the Mod Browser in [TModLoader](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/). Upon entering a Terraria world, the mod will begin trying to connect to the Crowd Control Desktop Application. You will receive a message in Terraria chat when the connection is established. (If playing multiplayer, the server must be a dedicated server).</br>
Alternatively, the mod can be downloaded manually from the [Releases](https://github.com/MrG-bit/TerrariaCrowdControlMod/releases) tab. Place the *.tmod* file in the Mods folder located in "Documents>My Games>Terraria>ModLoader". You will then need to enable the mod in TModLoader.
